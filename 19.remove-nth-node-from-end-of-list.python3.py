#
# Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its
# head.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
# 
# After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes
# 1->2->3->5.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# Given n will always be valid.
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you do this in one pass?
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
